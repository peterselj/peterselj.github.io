			<strong>Hello, I'm Josh.</strong>
		</div><br>
		<h2>Nice to meet you.</h2>
			<p>By day I work on international projects at Spotify NYC. By night I go to shows, I cook, I lift weights, I read books (I'm not big on TV), I remember to call my parents (usually), and I write. </p>

		<h2><span id='Things'></span><br>Things I write.</h2>
			<p>
			You should sign up for <a href='http://goo.gl/forms/rwtZWja4Ps'>updates from me by email</a>.<br><br>

			About once a month, I'll publish an essay on the most interesting thing I can think of. Subject matter spans business, pop culture, and the future. Short enough to read in a single sitting, long enough to provoke thoughtful dialogue.<br><br>

			I don't keep a blog anymore (<a href='http://www.blog.joshpetersel.com/'>I did</a> for about 10 years). Today, my work is distributed exclusively by email, and lives entirely within Google Docs &mdash; an ecosystem where it's easier than anywhere else I could think of for me and my readers to comment (in-line) and converse (via Gmail).<br><br>

			My metric of choice is not "scale," or millions of viewers, or thousands of shares. I don't chase clicks. My metric is dialogue. In 2016-17, every 1,000 words I wrote turned into over 3,000 words in comments from about two dozen loyal readers. I'm proud of that.<br><br>

			If being a part of this conversation sounds interesting, <a href='http://goo.gl/forms/rwtZWja4Ps'>again, you can sign up here</a>. If you want to see a few samples first, you can check out the Featured essays below.

			<p><b>Global Warming</b> is an enormous, problematic, confounding issue which may cause the end of the world as we know it. Can you solve Global Warming in 2,200 words? I give it a shot. Or, at least, I take a realistic look at <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YiQwmPUlcHd5oR8xuXoPKSPN5RsUB1YzENE0XqHCbJI/edit?usp=sharing'>how to get us started</a>. </p><br><br>

			<p><b>Don't Sell Shovels:</b> It's considered savvy business advice to say "If there's a gold rush, you want to be the one selling shovels." This seemed like bullshit. So <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/19sJC19dMBy0yre63jMXJfOpiu_Hd5vaX2HKEBq4QSAQ/edit?usp=sharing'>I explored why</a>.</p>

			<p>
			<b>Slow Jams.</b> I used to run a music magazine. I've traveled the world to cover concerts. Right now I work at Spotify. One surprising thing I've found: I'm tired of discovering music. It's exhausting. I think it's time we slow down, and give music a chance to be something more than just a treadmill of fleeting aural fixations. Here's why and how <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNx0V_wczJ3s19I3GRDIllGKftEKRrTMjjAeP2pbAyE/edit?usp=sharing'>I practice listening to music slowly</a>.</p><br>

			<p><b>SoulCycle is not why poor people are fat.</b> A Vox editor blames SoulCycle for the epidemic of crummy health among poor people. I dissected why it's not SoulCycle's fault, and more importantly, proposed an alternative to how we as individuals might <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PeI3leiE9qqbLXk8B69pC_XmQxd1r9gk6Ok-HbaNI6Y/edit?usp=sharing'>make a practical difference in the health and fitness</a> of those around us.</p>

		<h2><span id='Past'></span><br>Past essays.</h2>
			<p>Here's a word bank of essays I've published. It isn't exhaustive&#8230; and is probably often not even sensical (to be fair, my titles haven't been algoritmically designed to capture clicks). But maybe you get the idea.</p>

		<h2><br><span id='Etc'></span>Other work.</h2>
			<p>I've written for Consequence of Sound, Forbes, The Next Web, The Inertia, The Harbus, and of course, a litany of pieces for my old company <i>Eleven Magazine</i>.<br><br>

			I occasionally perform careers services (Resume, Search, and Interview prep) for up-and-coming graduates who are business-minded and looking to work in tech. I've helped people land roles they love (Product Managers, Business Analysts, etc.) at growth startups to companies like Facebook to growth startups. <a href='mailto:josh@joshpetersel.com'>Email me directly</a> to inquire.
